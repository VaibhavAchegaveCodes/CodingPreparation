Step 31
Inside the figure element you just added, nest an img element with a src attribute set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg.

<figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg">
          
        </figure>


Step 32
To improve accessibility of the image you added, add an alt attribute with the text:

Five cats looking around a field.

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">


Step 33
After the last img element, add a figcaption element with the text Cats hate other cats.

 <figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">
          <figcaption>Cats hate other cats.</figcaption>
          
        </figure>


Step 34
The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.

In the figcaption you just added, indicate that hate is of strong importance by wrapping it in a strong element.

<figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>


Step 35
It is time to add a new section. Add a third section element below the second section element.

<section>
        <h2>Cat Lists</h2>
        <h3>Things cats love:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>cat nip</li>
          <li>laser pointers</li>
          <li>lasagna</li>
        </ul>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
          <figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>  
        </figure>
        <h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>flea treatment</li>
          <li>thunder</li>
          <li>other cats</li>
        </ol>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">
          <figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>  
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section>
      </section>


Step 36
Inside the third section element, add an h2 element with the text:

Cat Form

<section>
        <h2>Cat Form</h2>
      </section>


Step 37
Now you will add a web form to collect information from users.

The form element is used to get information from a user like their name, email, and other details.

After the Cat Form heading, add a form element.

<h2>Cat Form</h2>
        <form>
        </form>


Step 38
The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent.

Here is an example of a form element with an action attribute:

Example Code
<form action="/submit-url"></form>
In the example, action="/submit-url" tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.

Add an action attribute with the value https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo to the form element.

<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        </form>


Step 39
The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are a void element and do not need closing tags.

Nest an input element in the form element.

<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        <input>
          
        </form>


Step 40
There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.

Create a text field to get text input from a user by adding the type attribute with the value text to the input element.

<input type="text">
