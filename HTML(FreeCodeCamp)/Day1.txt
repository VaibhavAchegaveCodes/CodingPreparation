Step 1
HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>. The text an element will display goes between its opening and closing tags.
Change the text of the h1 element below from Hello World to CatPhotoApp and watch the change in the browser preview.
When you are done, press the "Check Your Code" button to see if it's correct.
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Step 2
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.

Example Code
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with this text:

Cat Photos

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
  </body>
</html>

Step 3
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a p element below your h2 element and give it the following text:

Everyone loves cute cats online!

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
  </body>
</html>

Step 4
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->.

Here is an example of a comment with the TODO: Remove h1:

Example Code
<!-- TODO: Remove h1 -->
Add a comment above the p element with this text:

TODO: Add link to cat photos

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->    
    <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
    
  </body>
</html>

Step 5
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

Example Code
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element.

<html>
  <body>
    <main>  
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
    <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
    </main>
    
  </body>
</html>

Step 6
In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

Here is an example of nesting and indentation:

Example Code
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
The h1 element, h2 element and the comment are indented two spaces more than the main element in the code below. Use the space bar on your keyboard to add two more spaces in front of the p element so that it is indented properly as well.

<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

Step 7
You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. An element without a closing tag is known as a void element.

Add an img element below the p element. At this point, no image will show up in the browser.

<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
      <img>
      
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

Step 8
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).

Here is an example of an img element with a src attribute pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo:

Example Code
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_secondary.svg">
Inside the existing img element, add a src attribute with this URL:

https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg

<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg">
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

Step 9
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Here is an example of an img element with an alt attribute:

Example Code
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">
Inside the img element, add an alt attribute with this text:

A cute orange cat lying on its back

<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back">
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

Step 10
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element.

Here is an example linking to https://www.freecodecamp.org:

Example Code
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"></a>
Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview.

<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
      <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com"></a>
      
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
