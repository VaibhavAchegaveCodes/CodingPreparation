Step 41
In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted.

Here is an example of an input element with a name attribute:

Example Code
<input type="text" name="name">
Add the name attribute with the value catphotourl to your text field.

<input type="text" name="catphotourl">


Step 42
Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input.

Here is an example of an input element with a placeholder set to Ex. Jane Doe:

Example Code
<input type="text" placeholder="Ex. Jane Doe">
Add the placeholder text cat photo URL to your input element.

<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL">


Step 43
To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>


Step 44
The button element is used to create a clickable button.

Add a button element with the text Submit below the input element. The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.

<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
          <button>Submit</button>


Step 45
Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.

The button you added will submit the form by default. However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button.

 <button type="submit">Submit</button>


Step 46
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

Here is an example of a radio button with the text set as cat:

Example Code
<input type="radio"> cat
Remember that an input element is a void element.

Before the text input, add a radio button with the text set as:

Indoor

<input type="radio">Indoor
          <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>


Step 47
label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers).

Here is an example of a label element with a radio button:

Example Code
<label><input type="radio"> cat</label>
In the example, clicking on the word "cat" will also select the radio button.

Nest your radio button inside a label element.

<label><input type="radio"> Indoor</label>


Step 48
The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.

Here is an example of an input element with an id attribute:

Example Code
<input id="email">
Add an id attribute with the value indoor to the radio button. When elements have multiple attributes, the order of the attributes doesn't matter.

<label><input type="radio" id="indoor"> Indoor</label>


Step 49
Create another radio button below the first one. Nest it inside a label element with Outdoor as the label text. Give the radio button an id attribute with outdoor as the value.

<label><input id="indoor" type="radio"> Indoor</label>
          <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio"> Outdoor</label>


Step 50
Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.

Here is an example of two radio buttons with the same name attribute:

Example Code
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Breakfast
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Lunch
Add the name attribute with the value indoor-outdoor to both radio buttons.

<label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
          <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
